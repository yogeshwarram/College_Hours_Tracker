# College_Hours_Tracker
In this project, we have implemented a concept of College hours tracker system for college students with the help of QR code. Identification has become a necessary process in almost all fields. This app is concentrated on the main theme that is to reduce human effort and effective utilization of time. Due to this, accuracy of identification is maintained. The app reads the information of student i.e., PRN. Then it gets information from Database and sends the SMS to pre-stored parent’s mobile no. The SMS is sent with the help of Messaging API .Here the time and date maintained by using a System Clock. So finally the parent gets the information about their ward’s attendance.

## Software Requirement
1.Android OS version 5(Lollipop) & above

2.MS SQL Server

3.SMS service provider


## How it works ?
• The app includes scanner which scans the QR code on Student’s ID card and sends text alerts automatically to their parents.

• Also, Non-ID card holders (Visitors) need to register through the app for entry into campus.

• Admin panel helps admin to monitor all the records and update it if required.
